    <h1>Saitama's Limitless Potential</h1>
    <p><b>Breaking the Limiter:</b> This core aspect of Saitama's character implies he surpassed human limitations, potentially achieving infinite potential for growth. Goku, despite transformations and training, seems bound by Saiyan biology and eventually reaches a plateau.<br>
        <b>Power: </b>Saitama has never used his full strength, defeating all opponents with casual punches. This hints at a massive hidden reserve, potentially exceeding even Goku's strongest forms.</p>

    <h1>
        Saitama Sneezes the Moon</h1>
        <p>during his battle with Garou, Saitama unleashes a casual sneeze with unimaginable force. This sneeze blows away the entire atmosphere of Jupiter, a gas giant planet with over 1,000 times the volume of Earth. This implies his casual actions possess power vastly exceeding anything Goku has displayed.</p>

            <h2>Implications for the Debate:</h2>
            
            <p> While Jupiter and the moon are different in size and composition, this feat demonstrates the absurd level of power Saitama wields even when not taking a fight seriously. It suggests Saitama's true potential far exceeds even his strongest displayed punches.</p>
            <p> The fact that Saitama achieves this with a sneeze, an involuntary action, further supports the argument that his true power remains untapped. This unpredictability could be a significant advantage against Goku, who relies on transformations and training to access his full power.</p>
