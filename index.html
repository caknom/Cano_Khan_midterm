    <h1>Saitama's Limitless Potential</h1>
    <p><b>Breaking the Limiter:</b> This core aspect of Saitama's character implies he surpassed human limitations, potentially achieving infinite potential for growth. Goku, despite transformations and training, seems bound by Saiyan biology and eventually reaches a plateau.<br>
        <b>Power: </b>Saitama has never used his full strength, defeating all opponents with casual punches. This hints at a massive hidden reserve, potentially exceeding even Goku's strongest forms.</p>
